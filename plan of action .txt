project 3: Plan for Action 

I'll read the log file line by line by python and create a list containing all lines in the log file. To be specific, I can create a list and each element of it is a line in the log file which is another list containing date, time, activity, server and user email ID. 

To make everything more organized, I'll sort the list by name, date and time. In that way, the same person's activity in a day will be listed together.

A function will be defined for each insight required including suspicious activities, irresponsible behavior, system glitch and domain count. Thus, there will be 5 functions in total ( not including the extra credit insight).

For the suspicious activities, I need to check if a person log in more than 5 times in a single day or log in between 12:00 am to 5:00 am.

For the irresponsible behavior and system glitch, I need to check whether the number of log in matches the number of log out for a person in a single day. Counting the number of log in is also useful to find the suspicious activities. I'll create a list for each person. Each element in that list contains the number of log in and the number of log out for that person in a single day.

To count domains, the first step is to make a list containing emails. The next step is to get rid of repeated emails. Then put all domains in a list and count the number of each domain using dictionary.
